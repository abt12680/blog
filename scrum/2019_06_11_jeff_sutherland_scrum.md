# SCRUM - The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time

《[SCRUM - The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time][4]》读书笔记

"知其然，知其所以然"，理解 Scrum 设计者设计这套规则的由来，可以更好地理解 Scrum。


## CH00 - Preface

 * SCRUM - a faster, more reliable, more effective way to create software in the tech industry
 * In 1993, I invented a new way of doing things: Scrum


## CH01 - The Way the World Works Is Broken

### About Waterfall Method

![](images/2019_06_11_jeff_sutherland_scrum/waterfall_method.png)

 * Waterfall Method (瀑布模型)，适用于"按部就班、需求严谨"的软件开发
 * 现代软件需求变更快速，Waterfall Method 已不适合
 * 举例：FBI 的几个软件项目都失败了，最后改用敏捷方法，成功了

### About Gantt chart

 * Gantt chart (甘特图) 是不准确的


## CH02 - The Origins of Scrum

### Jeff 职业生涯

 * 西点军校毕业，飞行员，参加越南战争 (精英小团队工作模式)
 * Stanford AI Lab 工作 12 年 (统计学毕业)
 * 1983年，加入 MidContinent，利用 Scrum 的思想，主导 ATM 开发

### System Theory

 * I learned a lot about systems theory and how a system only has certain stable states.
 * The same things that move cells from one state to another are also waht move people from one state to another.

### Inspect and Adapt

 * flying in Vietnam: **O**bserve, **O**rient, **D**ecide, **A**ct
 * W. Edwards Deming: the PDCA cycle (**P**lan, **D**o, **C**heck, **A**ct)

paper airplanes (three roles)

 * One person will check how many planes are built that can actually fly (PO)
 * Another will work as part of the assembly process but will also pay attention to the process itself and look for ways that the team can make better planes and speed up their production (SM)
 * Everyone else will concentrate on building as many planes that can actually fly the distance in the assembly time allowed (the Team)
 * PO - 主导方向(business)
 * SM - 关注过程改进
 * Team - 关注开发本身

### Shu Ha Ri

 * Shu - you know all the rules and the forms
 * Ha - once you've mastered the forms, you can make innovations
 * Ri - you're able to discard the forms, you've truly mastered the practice, and you're able to be creative in an unhindered(不受妨碍的) way.


## CH03 - Teams

 * Communication channels = n * (n-1) / 2
 * Keep your teams small
 * System Thinking - 环境决定团队的能力/行为


## CH04 - Time


## CH05 - Waste Is a Crime
